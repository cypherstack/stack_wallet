# This file configures the analyzer, which statically analyzes Dart code to
# check for errors, warnings, and lints.
#
# The issues identified by the analyzer are surfaced in the UI of Dart-enabled
# IDEs (https://dart.dev/tools#ides-and-editors). The analyzer can also be
# invoked from the command line by running `flutter analyze`.

# The following line activates a set of recommended lints for Flutter apps,
# packages, and plugins designed to encourage good coding practices.

  errors:
    # Without ignore here, we cause import of all_lint_rules to warn, because some rules conflict.
    # We explicitly enabled even conflicting rules and are fixing the conflicts in this file.
    # Put it to warning temporarily, if you need troubleshoot lint rule settings.
    included_file_warning: ignore

    # Treat missing required parameters as an error, not as a hint or a warning.
    missing_required_param: error

    # Treat missing returns as an error, not as a hint or a warning.
    missing_return: error

    # Allow self-reference to deprecated members. This is done because otherwise we have
    # to annotate every member in every test, assert, etc., when we deprecate something.

    # DON'T assign new values to parameters of methods or functions.

    #
    # Treat assigning new values to a parameter as a warning. We would almost like to set this
    # to an error. However, this warning rule or even more so if set to an error, can sometimes
    # be a bit problematic you include other code directly that does it a lot.
    # It does however, make code safer when this cannot be done without involving
    # an extra local variable for clarity and safety. Enabling this error, even as just a warning,
    # does get in the way a bit if all you want to do is a null to default value release runtime
    # safety/fallback assignment. For that use case you have to add a local rule override. With
    # null-safety, the need for this kind of null check and re-assignment to default if null,
    # is rarely needed. Considering the comment in:
    # https://dart-lang.github.io/linter/lints/parameter_assignments.html:
    # "Assigning new values to parameters is generally a bad practice unless an operator
    # such as ??= is used. Otherwise, arbitrarily reassigning parameters is usually a mistake."
    # One might even think the rule would allow using the ??= operator, but it does not. For now,
    # we keep this lint as warning and overriding locally with:
    #
    # When we need it for the ??= operator, or some copy/paste in of some code that does things
    # that needs it too, and that we don't want to deal with fixing at the moment.
    parameter_assignments: warning

    # Allow having TODOs in the code.

linter:
  # The lint rules applied to this project can be customized in the
  # section below to disable rules from the `package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml`
  # included above or to enable additional rules. A list of all available lints
  # and their documentation is published at
  # https://dart-lang.github.io/linter/lints/index.html.
  #
  # Instead of disabling a lint rule for the entire project in the
  # section below, it can also be suppressed for a single line of code
  # or a specific dart file by using the `// ignore: name_of_lint` and
  # `// ignore_for_file: name_of_lint` syntax on the line or in the file
  # producing the lint.
